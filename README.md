# PixGuessr

Given a random image, guess it by describing it! If your description contains enough registered keywords, you get a point!

-- First commit - v1.0.0 --<br>
-Just an hypotetical template right now.<br>
-Mobile only yet.<br>
-Missing logic for keywords and answer arrays comparison.<br>

-- v1.0.1 --<br>
-The provided answer is now processed into an array of words, excluding all the ortography and other symbols.<br>
-The answer array is then compared with the keywords one in order to find all the matches.<br>
-Correctly guessed words are now displayed on screen<br>
-Still mobile only.<br>
